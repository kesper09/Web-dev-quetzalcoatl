# Slicing Performance Comparison: 2 Cores vs 16 Cores


**Note:** All slicing jobs were executed in parallel (batch mode) on each machine and both machines used for benchmarking had 8GB of RAM.

This table compares the slicing statistics for each model when run on a 2-core VM versus a 16-core local machine. Key differences:
- **User time** is consistently lower on 16 cores, indicating faster computation.
- **System time** is higher on 16 cores, likely due to increased parallelism and I/O.
- **CPU%** is much higher on 16 cores, showing better CPU utilization.
- **Max RSS** (memory usage, now in MB) is generally higher on 16 cores, possibly due to more threads in use.

**Term meanings:**
- **User time:** Time spent running the program's own code (lower is faster).
- **System time:** Time spent in OS/kernel operations (lower is better, but some increase is normal with more parallelism).
- **CPU%:** How much CPU was utilized (higher means better parallel usage).
- **Max RSS:** Peak memory used (in MB); shows memory demand, should fit within available RAM.
